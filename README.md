# GraphQL Restaurant Exercise

This assignment was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course. 

## Use GraphQL to query and update data

Creating multi-tier applications means building multiple API endpoints to handle different data operations. The more complex your application becomes, the harder it is to maintain all these endpoints. GraphQL aims to reduce this complexity by providing a simpler view of data and making it easier to query it. 

Your task is to set up GraphQL for your restaurant data and then add mutations to get and update the data. 
To accomplish this task, you need to implement the following methods under the “root” object: 


- restaurant: This gets a single restaurant based on a provided ID. 
- restaurants: This gets a list of all restaurants. 
- setrestaurant: This creates a new restaurant. 
- Deleterestaurant: This deletes a restaurant based on the provided id.
- editrestaurant: This updates a restaurant based on the provided id.
